Homepage,default,index,"<h2>Support Cumbria</h2><p>Support Cumbria is a collaboration of agencies and communities within the County of Cumbria to offer support during a major incident at a community level.</p><p>Cumbria appreciates and is thankful to all those wishing to volunteer their time, offer accommodation, offer donated goods or wish to raise money to support those affected. The greatest benefit is felt through a coordinated response with preparation. Impacts and consequences of a Major Incident on people's lives can be devastating and wide ranging.</p><p>Disaster appeals are a way in which the public and businesses can support those impacted through allowing the individual to decide what is needed. Financial support allows people to make decisions and some control over the impacts. In Cumbria there is a partnership with Cumbria Community Foundation who will assist with processing disaster funds. Cumbria Community Foundation is part of a national and international network of community foundations.  Together we seek to support people and organisations wishing to invest in the local community. If a disaster fund is established you will be able to find details on how to donate on their Website: <a href='https://www.cumbriafoundation.org'>https://www.cumbriafoundation.org/</a></p><p>Other ways to support communities during a major incident is to donate items or volunteer your time.</p>"

You will find information here to help out during an ongoing incident or to be ready to act in the future.</p><h3>Safe Volunteering</h3><p>It is natural that people who are local to an incident may consider attending the scene to see if they can help, or offer to assist neighbours or local residents. This is called self-deployment and falls outside of the co-ordinated response (and this website). You need to consider your own and others' safety as you do not fall under the insurance of responding organisations.</p><p>We ask you not to self-deploy and any self-deployment in the affected area is done at your own risk. Although we understand you might be keen travel to the affected area as soon as possible to offer assistance, but routes need to be kept clear for emergency services vehicles and personnel.</p><p>Instead, follow the links below, which will enable you to be deployed in a safe and effective way.</p></div></div><div class='row'><div class='large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns'><div class='panel radius'><a href='/eden/default/index/register'><img src='/eden/static/themes/CCC/img/register_volunteer.svg'/><span class='service-link'>REGISTER AS A VOLUNTEER</span></a></div></div></div><div class='row'><div class='medium-12 columns'><p>It is also important to remember that a sustained volunteering effort will be required to help people recover from a major incident and often there is more need for volunteers in the weeks following an incident.

This can be important dealing with the well being of those affected.</li><li>Furniture - Think about 'saleable' condition as a bench mark.</li><li>Soft Furnishing - It is important that these meet the Furniture and Furnishings (Fire Safety) Regulations 1988 (as amended).</li><li>Soft Toys and Games - Please ensure these are in excellent condition and complete, and meet the British Standards Kitemark and the <a href='https://www.bsigroup.com/LocalFiles/en-GB/consumer-guides/resources/BSI-Consumer-Brochure-Playing-Safe-UK-EN.pdf' target='_blank'>Toy (Safety) Regulations 2011</a>.</li><li>Cleaning Products/Equipment - These need to be sealed and in original packaging to ensure any irritants and usage instructions are clearly available.</li></ul><h3>Where else could I take things?</h3><p>Support Cumbria works with a number of organisations and charities.
